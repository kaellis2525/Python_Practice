Some of my early Python projects and practice scripts from when I was first learning to code and figuring things out through trial and error. This repo shows steady progress on inputs, conditionals, loops, and string handling.

### What is inside
• bank.py  simple text handling and branching  
• calculator.py  basic arithmetic and user input  
• mario.py  loops and printing patterns  
• twttr.py  string transforms and iteration

### How to run
python <file.py>
